`How to run the program?`

+ The user can start by running the [program](https://github.com/Rishabh705/Building-Simulation/blob/master/Building.cpp) and the possible instructions will be given to the user.
+ You can type 'help' whenever you forget the commands.
+ To issue a book in library, you need to be a member first. Manager id (to add user to library): 007
+ To park a car you need to provide a pin, so then only you can unpark the car.
+ Names with spaces will not be accepted.

`In this project we simulate a building using concepts of object-oriented programming with commands.`

`Inside the building, a customer is able to park his/her vehicle, view, checkin and checkout a flat, enjoy a game and read books in the library inside building.`

`The data of library, parking lot and flats is also copied to respective files of same name by the time program execution is completed`

`This code works on both windows and linux`

This repository currently contains 6 files in which 5 are header files and 1 is driver file. Folders for sample [books](https://github.com/Rishabh705/Building-Simulation/tree/master/books) and [pictures](https://github.com/Rishabh705/Building-Simulation/tree/master/pics) are also uploaded.

You can view the UML for each of the classes used near the end of file description.

_Description of files are given below :_-

## 1. [flat.h](https://github.com/Rishabh705/Building-Simulation/blob/master/flat.h)

``class Flat``  

Private Member Functions ->

## 4. [clubhouse.h](https://github.com/Rishabh705/Building-Simulation/blob/master/clubhouse.h)

This file handles all the games like othello game in [game.h](https://github.com/Rishabh705/Building-Simulation/blob/master/game.h) above. Here more class files similar to `game.h` for games can be added easily and thus no major changes will be needed.

This file has one class. It's breif description is given below:

`class ClubHouse`

Private Member Functions ->

+ void inputCommands(): To get commands input from user
+ void displayCommands(): To display commands to user
+ void enterClubHouse(): To start the functionality of club house ie play whichever game from the available ones the user wants to (this is created as a function and not a constructor so that we can enter and exit the club house as per our convenience without having to declare a new object everytime)

## Driver code file : [Building.cpp](https://github.com/Rishabh705/Building-Simulation/blob/master/Building.cpp)

This file combines all above files and uses them to simulate a Building.

+ void displayCommands() : to display all accepted commands.
+ main()

 More files can be added easily and integrated with the program with near to no changes in original code. (only addition) 

`Some details:`
+ The [building](https://github.com/Rishabh705/Building-Simulation/blob/master/Building.cpp) contains 10 floors with 4 flats on each floor.
+ It also contains a [library](https://github.com/Rishabh705/Building-Simulation/blob/master/library.h), [parking lot](https://github.com/Rishabh705/Building-Simulation/blob/master/parking.h) and [clubhouse](https://github.com/Rishabh705/Building-Simulation/blob/master/clubhouse.h)
+ You can buy or sell flats
+ You can become a library member
+ You can park and unpark your car and find it
+ You can play [Othello](https://github.com/Rishabh705/Building-Simulation/blob/master/game.h) (currently only game in clubhouse)
